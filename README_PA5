Open zip file: Salam_PropositionalEncoding
Then in Terminal in src compile:
	javac Main.java
And run with the argument:
	"S(NP(Name(Amy)),VP(Verb(gave),NP(Det(the),Adj(pretty),Noun(flowers)),PP(Prep(to),NP(Det(the),Adj(small),Noun(boy)))))"

*My program will generate the correct tree for any Parenthesized Expression
*But I had trouble parsing the tree to produce a symbolic representation
*So it should compile for any parenthesized expression, but the symbolic representation varies in its correctness by input. With the above it works.

Thanks again
